# This Website

## Using Nuxt.js to create my own website.

## Why?

The goal of my website is simply to have a centralized place where I can showcase my hobbies, interest, and achievements. As a programmer, this also acts as a portfolio of some of the projects I've worked on also available on my Github. I've recently gotten into 3d modeling and animation using blender, some of that work is showcased on my Instagram. I would also like to create some form of video content and plan to host that on youtube. In the end, this website will be the one-stop shop to see what I've been up to. 

## Why Nuxt?

When I first was getting into web development I had a friend recommend me Vue. Later I did try React and ANgular however vue just always felt intuitive to me. Nuxt offers SSR capabilities where in the future I can take advantage of SEO to extend my reach. This was one reason I chose Nuxt however, the main reason I chose this framework is because of how well integrated certain plugins and modules are. The CLI is fantastic at getting a project up with things like tailwind, vuetify, typescript, and other nice features. Nuxt also has the content module built-in so creating this blog is as easy as creating new markdown files.
