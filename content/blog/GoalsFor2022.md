# Technologies I look to learn in 2022.

## Rust

With C/C++ being 50 years old Rust offers a modern take on this old but efficient language that I personally use frequently. Rust prides itself on like C being very low level while also being memory safe. This addresses both the positives a C being low level while also fixing "flaws" of C being its memory management or lack thereof. Rust also has the ability to compile down to web assembly allowing you to also create web applications with it. All of these reasons show why it is a powerful language and why so many people are excited about its future.

## Go

Go or specifically Golang has produced a very avid following specifically my software engineering friends who push for it so heavily. In my use cases, I don't see it being as much as a fit unlike rust however, it can be used for web apps, and because of that it may fit better as a Node JS replacement for me but I will have to do more research about it.

## Web3

Web3 has become a sort of buzzword specifically on the backs of the success of NFTs. Where Web2 (our current internet) is built on interactivity Web3 will be built around ownership. The way I currently understand it is instead of having a separate cookie used for each individual site you become the cookie and you use this same identifier on every site as well as own the data associated with you. I'm still fuzzy on the practicality of all this and am unsure of the use cases but crypto has passed the point of being a fad and I will be looking forward to seeing how it is integrated into our lives... At least before quantum computers crack it.
